# Fetch on Render

To demonstrate the `fetch-on-render` approach to getting data into a React application:

- Open your developer tools and go to the Network tab
- Click on any of the `posts` below and observe the waterfall of the requests and the order in which the components are rendered!

### ⚠️ Requests are faked and artificially slowed down!
